[x] set up file structure 

[x] create interface where user can input two values

STRETCH GOALS 

[ ] Convert the interface to look and behave
like an actual calculator 

[x] Only allow the POST call to happen
    if all necessary input is ready
    [x] Show an alert if they left something empty
        and don't send bad or incomplete
        data to the server
[x] allow a user to clear the history 
    by clicking on a button
    [ ] this should not be get or post,
        Look into 'DELETE' request.
[ ] allow a user to click on an entry
    in the history list to re-run that calculation
    [ ] this should display the answer 
        on the calculator interface
        like a normal calculation
[ ] Deploy to Heroku!
